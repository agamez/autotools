This projects pretends to be a simple guide/skeleton/help to use create autootols managed packages.

Steps taken:

1.- Wrote libs/libHello.c
2.- Wrote apps/hello.c
3.- Wrote libs/Makefile.am
4.- Wrote apps/Makefile.am
5.- Wrote Makefile.am
6.- Execute autoscan
    This generates file configure.scan which is really useful because it
    searches for all Makefile.am files and writes libraries, headers,
    typedefs, structures, and compiler checks based on the source code
    it analyzes.
7.- Rename configure.scan to configure.ac and edit it to reflect the following:
    * Project name, version and email of the maintainer
    * Attend to FIXME notes generated by autoscan (for example, library function definition)
    * Include other autogenerated files (for example, pkg-config.pc files)
    * Add AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE([foreign]). We use foreign because we won't follow GNU standard
      directory structure, which would force us to have files NEWS, AUTHORS, etc
    * Add LT_INIT() because we want to use libtool. This require a couple changes too, which
      consist on defining the directory that m4 will use to store its macro and files
8.- We can now execute autoreconf --install which will generate configure script and all
    other necessary files.
9.- Now, we can run ./configure && make && make install
10.- Profit!
